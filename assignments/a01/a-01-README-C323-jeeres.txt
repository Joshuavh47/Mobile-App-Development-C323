Josh Eres - jeeres

I personally completed most of the actual coding. Specifically the ipsum model and both view controllers. Jalen made the chat view, and I made the history view and connected everything, including the tab controller. 
An interesting part of this that we added were a cool color scheme and a tab bar that stands out so that one is able to see the buttons clearly. 

I contributed the most to this assignment. 
Vedaant contributed the least to the assignment, but this was expected because he is recovering from a concussion. 
Everyone contributed something tp the assignment.
There were no problems with the team.

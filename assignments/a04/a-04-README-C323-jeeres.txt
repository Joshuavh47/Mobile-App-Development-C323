1. In this assignment, I updated the UMLs and app description to take the peer review and the TA's comments into consideration. I also made the timeline and team contract and added them to our a04 folder in our team's repo. In addition, I added what we have so far in our Xcode project for the final project. 

2. I was wondering whether we are allowed to use free, open source sprites in our project for sprite textures with SpriteKit (with proper attribution and credit given, of course.) I didn't know if this is ok because in the assignment 4 instructions, it says that UI elements must be our own work. Please let me know if the inclusion of these textures are not allowed, and I can take them out and change them in assignment 5 and going forward. 

3. All team members contributed equally to assignment 4.

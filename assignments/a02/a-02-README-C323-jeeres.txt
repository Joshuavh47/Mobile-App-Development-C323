	a. I would say I contributed slightly more because I was in charge of implementing the concentric circles part of the assignment, which is inherently harder. 

	b. Camille probably did a little less work, but it was a very even split- as close as you can to 50-50 because we would collaborate on bug fixes. 

	c. Everyone contributed to the assignment. 

	d. There were no problems in my team.

3. In this lab, we implemented lab 20 and lab 21, except with flipped functionality (instead of the ball moving based on the accelerometer, the concentric circles move this way and instead of the circles moving based on touch, the ball moves this way.) We then combined these in a tab view so that the user is able to swich between the two.

1. For this assignment, me and Jalen worked together on completing a UI Wireframe, UML Activity Diagram, UML Use Case Diagram, UML class diagram, as well as an app description for our final project app. We used the "share", google docs-like functionality in LucidChart to accomplish this for all of the diagrams, as well as free sprites to model the wireframe, which we have linked as references in the corresponding PDF file. 

2. We contributed equally to this assignment, as we were in a zoom call while both contributing to every part of the assignment. No one contributed more than the other. 

3. No one contributed less than the other because we were working on this assignment concurrently over a zoom call and through LucidChart's "share" feature. 

4. Everyone in the group (me and Jalen) contributed to the assignment. 

5. There were no problems within our team.

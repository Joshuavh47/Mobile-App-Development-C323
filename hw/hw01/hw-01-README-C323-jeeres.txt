1. For this assignment, I first created all of the buttons and labels I needed in the main storyboard. Then, after copying over the starter code files, I created lebel variables and button functions for each label and button in my storyboard, and connected them in the storyboard. Then, I wrote a function for the + and - buttons that get the ascii code for whatever letter is appearing, and then add/subtract 1 if possible and convert it back to a character. This is how the + and - buttons are able to update each label. Then, I implemented the function that checks if an answer is correct. After this, I implemented the start game function and the new game function so that all of the correct values are initialized whenever the app loads or the user presses the new game button. Then, I added more 3 letter words to the word bank. 

2. To make this project more interesting, I customized the colors so that they are not too bland. I also added some new words to the word bank. I also think that it is extremely tedious that chars can not be converted directly to ints in swift (like 99% of other languages) without first converting to a UnicodeScalar first, and vice versa. I think that to make this even more interesting, you could get words from an online database so there can be way more possible correct solutions to the game, or maybe introduce levels that increase the character size of the words the harder the level you're on.

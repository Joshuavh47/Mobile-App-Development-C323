1. For this project, I implemented the GuessThreeLetters game from hw01 in SwiftUI. This was relatively simple, thanks to VStacks and HStacks, which made the organization of similar groups of Buttons and Text objects (like the plus/guessLetter/minus) very easy and uniform. Implementing this game using the model from hw01 required few changes due to how State variables worked throughout this homework assignment. The only difference between the two is that instead of using variable.text, all you have to do is update the state variable where the text is stored. 

2. One thing I thought was cool that I did was adding custom colors via the asset manager. This was my first time doing so, and it makes adding custom colors and images very easy. I used this method to change the color of the background for the game.

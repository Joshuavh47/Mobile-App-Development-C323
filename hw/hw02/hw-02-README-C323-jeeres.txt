1. For this assignment, I created a tab view controller and also made another view and view controller. I then created a delegate for the text view i created in the new view. I used this to update the text view with the viewWillAppear function. 

2. To make this assignment look nicer, I used the same color scheme on the newly created view as I did in hw01

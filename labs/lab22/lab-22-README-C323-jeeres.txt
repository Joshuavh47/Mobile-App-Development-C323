1. In this lab, I used delegates to reference a model class. First, I created a tab view, and I set up the input view and the table view controller. Then, I implemented the functions associated with a UITableViewController. After this, I implemented the text fields in py input view and made a button that updates the corresponding variables for the columns and rows in my model. I also included a reload function in my viewWillLoad function so that if you change the rows and columns values in the input view and then go back into the table view, the table view will update to conform to the new dimensions of the table. 

2. An interesting thing I included in this lab is a custom color scheme. I made some custom color schemes in the assets section that I use for my table view.

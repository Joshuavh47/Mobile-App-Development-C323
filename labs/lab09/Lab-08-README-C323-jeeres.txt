1. For this lab, I successfully followed the instructions in the lab09 and hw02 instructions to clone and change the name of the lab08 assignment. Then, I followed the instructions provided to implement the text delegate in the new view controllerw that I made last lab for the new view. I then made sure that it worked, but to do this I had to disable a setting in the iOS simulator in order to make the software keyboard show up (this stumped me for a long time.)

2. As a cool demo, I temporarily enabled developer mode on my iphone and connected it to my computer to run this app on my phone. It worked, however because my phone is bigger than the iPhone SE that we are developing for, the view didn't look that great because there were no constraints specified on the objects in the view.

1. For this lab task, I added a variable to replave the 500 in the ball velocity calculation. In doing so, the user can easily adjust the acceleration of the ball. I also edited the code in the conditions for if the ball hits the bounds of the screen, so that if the ball hits the right side of the screen, the velocity doesn't change and the x position goes to 0. If the ball hits the left side of the screen, the ball's x position goes to the screen width - the size of the ball image. If the ball hits the top of the screen, the ball's y position goes to the screen height - the ball's image height. And if the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the y position goes to 0.

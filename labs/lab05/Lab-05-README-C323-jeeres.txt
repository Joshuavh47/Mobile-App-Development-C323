1. For this lab, I created a new project with the blank iOS app template. Then, I went into the storyboard and added a button and a label. Then, I scaled both of these objects so that they fit within the phone under the top bar. I then created a variable in the view controller for the label, and a function for the button that prints to the console upon every press. I then went back to the storyboard and linked the variable and the function to the label and button respectively. 
2. I added a print statement to the button so that it prints to the console when pressed and I added a question for the label.

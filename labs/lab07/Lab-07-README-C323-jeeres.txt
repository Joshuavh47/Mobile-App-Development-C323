For this lab, I used ludichart. The email that is associated to my account is jeeres@iu.edu. For this UML diagram, I used a lot of the blank squares and solid arrows because a lot of parts associated with the app created in Homework 1 must be synchronous in order for the app to work. I separated the model, view, and controller boxes and attatched the certain veriables, lables, buttons, and functions that I'd need for all of these to their respective boxes (Model, View, or Controller) since the Model, View, and Controller are all connected.

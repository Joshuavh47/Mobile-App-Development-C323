1. I made an app that will show a question when a button is pressed and show the answer to that question when another button is pressed. To do this, I created another model that contains the functions that fetch the next question and answer so that the default model is able to display the returned question and answer strings. 
2. I added interesting questions and could potentially make the variable that controls what question and answer that are displayed random later.

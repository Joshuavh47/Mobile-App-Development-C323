1. In this lab, I added a UITabBarController to the previous lab project. After this, I made the view we made in the last lab one of the tab's view, and created another view to be used for another of the tab's views. Then, I changed the names and icons associated with each view in the tab bar, and proceeded to make the UI of the new view similar to the one from the last lab, except this one contains a UITextField. 

2. To make this more interesting, I changed the colors on the new view I created from the ones in the other view. I also changed the icons on the tab view to create some variety.

1. For this lab, I created structs that hold the VStacks for my +/- buttons qnd the guess labels. I also created struct that store each answer label. This allows me to instantiate these structs multiple times, and makes my code cleaner and easier to navigate. 

2. I tried to implement something to get the model to work, but I could not.

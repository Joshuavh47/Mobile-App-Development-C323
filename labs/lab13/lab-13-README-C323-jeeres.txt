Peer evaluation: 
Group 26 (Turquoise)

We all contributed a relatively equal amount to this assignment. No one really worked more than anyone else. The only problems we were having is that we were having trouble understanding how to use the encodable and decodable after implementing the functions. However we were eventually able to figure it out.

I am part of the turquoise team. We were able to communicate over both email and text message. We are going to try and finish the assignment in class on Thursday and work outside of class if we have to. This late meeting date is due to Jalen (one of our group members) not feeling well on Tuesday. 

Questions:
	1. Will the work-splitting of the assignment be determine based off of github commits?
	2. If this is the case, what if the work is done on one's computer using multiple partners' contributions, but is then committed by one person to github?
	3. How much of this assignment's grade makeup is going to consist of team participation? (I am not trying to call out my partners, I'm just curious about the assignment's point-makeup)
